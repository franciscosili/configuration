### VIM setup and configuration


1. Go to `$HOME` directory and copy `.vim/` and `.vimrc`
```
cd ~  
cp -r configuration/editors/vim/.vim .vimrc ./
```
2. Step only if your terminal doesn't support 16 colors. Follow steps in the (base16-shell)[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell] repository to install base16 colors.
3. Execute vim and everything will be installed automatically
```
vim
```
